## Code Explanation

The TickScalper code is written in MQL5 language and consists of several functions:

### 1. OnInit()

This function is called during the initialization of the Expert Advisor. It is used to add indicator code or any other initialization tasks. In this sample code, no specific indicator code is added.

### 2. OnTick()

This function is called on every tick of the market. It contains the main logic of the Expert Advisor. It checks for buy and sell signals using the `CheckBuySignal()` and `CheckSellSignal()` functions. If a buy signal is detected, it displays the buy signal using the `DisplayBuySignal()` function. Similarly, if a sell signal is detected, it displays the sell signal using the `DisplaySellSignal()` function.

### 3. CheckBuySignal()

This custom function is used to check for a buy signal. The actual buy signal logic is not provided in the sample code, and a placeholder `true` value is returned. Users are expected to replace this placeholder with their own buy signal logic.

### 4. CheckSellSignal()

This custom function is used to check for a sell signal. The actual sell signal logic is not provided in the sample code, and a placeholder `true` value is returned. Users are expected to replace this placeholder with their own sell signal logic.

### 5. DisplayBuySignal()

This custom function is used to display the buy signal on the control panel. In this sample code, the buy signal is displayed by printing a message. Users can add their own code to display the buy signal in their desired way.

### 6. DisplaySellSignal()

This custom function is used to display the sell signal on the control panel. In this sample code, the sell signal is displayed by printing a message. Users can add their own code to display the sell signal in their desired way.

### 7. EnterLongPosition()

This custom function is used to execute a trade based on the buy signal. The actual code to enter a long position is not provided in the sample code, and a message is printed instead. Users are expected to replace this placeholder code with their own code to enter a long position.

### 8. EnterShortPosition()

This custom function is used to execute a trade based on the sell signal. The actual code to enter a short position is not provided in the sample code, and a message is printed instead. Users are expected to replace this placeholder code with their own code to enter a short position.

### 9. OnDeinit(const int reason)

This function is called during the deinitialization of the Expert Advisor. It is used to perform any cleanup or deinitialization tasks. In this sample code, no specific deinitialization code is added.
